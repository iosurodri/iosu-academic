This project implements CombPool layer, a new pooling layer that enables the linear combination of different pooling functions, generating increasing functions as a result. Implementation for the paper: *Rodriguez-Martinez, I., Lafuente, J., Santiago, R. H., Dimuro, G. P., Herrera, F., & Bustince, H. (2022). Replacing pooling functions in Convolutional Neural Networks by linear combinations of increasing functions. Neural Networks, 152, 380-393.*
