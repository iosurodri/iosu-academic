This project offers an implementation for (a, b)-grouping pooling, a generalization of max pooling which focuses on high feature values and improves gradient flow. Implementation for the paper: [*Rodriguez-Martinez, I., da Cruz Asmus, T., Dimuro, G. P., Herrera, F., Takáč, Z., & Bustince, H. (2023). Generalizing max pooling via (a, b)-grouping functions for Convolutional Neural Networks. Information Fusion, 101893.*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253523002099)
